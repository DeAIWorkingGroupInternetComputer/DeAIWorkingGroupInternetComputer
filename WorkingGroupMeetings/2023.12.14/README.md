# 2023.12.14 Meeting Summary - DeAI Working Group for the Internet Computer (ICP)

## Project Overview and Technical Aspects
MotokoLearn is aimed at developing a library similar to Python's collect, catering to users who don't require GPUs. It deals with tabular data, not image or sound data, and uses machine learning models like ensemble trees. The technical details involve classifiers, regression models, binary trees, and handling instruction limits in the underlying protocol. There's also a discussion on the Motoko language used for development.

## Challenges and Solutions
The conversation in the call highlights challenges like instruction limits and high computational costs. Solutions include using a weight function in the algorithm and chunking processes to fit within instruction limits. The discussion indicates a future improvement plan to accommodate larger sample sizes and reduce costs.

## Platform and Integration Aspects
MotokoLearn is developed for the Internet Computer platform. There's a focus on how different hardware pieces, like GPUs, could be controlled and secured for AI applications on IC. Discussions on deploying Angular projects on IC and using Python packages suggest a versatile and developer-friendly approach.

## Community and Collaboration
New participants introduce themselves, bringing diverse backgrounds from infrastructure, node provisioning, and software development. They express interest in decentralized AI, particularly regarding the intensity of training AI models and the costs associated with on-chain activities. The idea of a GPU subnet and decentralized control of hardware resources is discussed as a potential community initiative.

## Future Plans and Next Steps
The group discusses transitioning their meetings to Discord for better integration and continuity. There's an intent to create a GitHub repository for the group, where they can share knowledge, showcase materials, and coordinate on technical initiatives like vector databases and the GPU subnet.

## Security and Neutrality in AI Models
There's a conversation about the importance of having AI models trained within a secure and neutral infrastructure to avoid issues like Trojan networks, where models behave as expected except under certain triggers.

## Decentralized Infrastructure and Node Providers
The discussion delves into the concept of decentralized infrastructure on the IC, where node providers contribute to a larger global platform. The idea is to extend control to individual GPU servers so that IC canisters can manage them securely.

In summary, the call covers a range of topics from technical details of MotokoLearn, challenges in AI model training and deployment, the potential of decentralized infrastructure in AI, to community collaboration and future initiatives. The focus is on leveraging the Internet Computer platform for efficient, secure, and cost-effective AI solutions.
