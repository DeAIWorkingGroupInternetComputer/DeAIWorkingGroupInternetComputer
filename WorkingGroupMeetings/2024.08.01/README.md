# 2024.08.01 Meeting Summary - DeAI Working Group for the Internet Computer (ICP)

## Short Version
In the latest DeAI call, the success of the recent Web3 AI hackathon was highlighted, which saw high-quality submissions focused on AI development using web technologies. Winning projects, such as DeDa, a decentralized data marketplace, Clanopedia and ICMLPL, which integrates the Flashlight deep learning library, will continue as developer grantees. The community is encouraged to participate in weekly calls for knowledge exchange, utilize the decentralized AI channel on Discord, and explore support programs like the Olympus accelerator for further growth and investment opportunities.

## Long Version
## AI hackathon or conference suggestions for DFINITY

If you have any AI hackathons or conferences to recommend, the DFINITY team would appreciate hearing from you. They are actively expanding their outreach to the AI community and would love to have ICP represented at relevant events.

## Introduction and Attendance

The call started with thanks to participants for joining, especially those from the Web3 AI hackathon. The focus was on AI development using web technologies, mentioning sponsors like Falcom and Spectral.

## Hackathon Overview

The recent Web3 AI hackathon had 8 submissions, all of high quality. Projects were posted on the Decentralized AI channel for visibility. Winning projects will continue as developer grantees.

## Winning Projects

**DeDa**:  
A decentralized data application and marketplace for AIML practitioners.

**Clanopedia**:  
Focuses on verifiable data sources.

**ICMLPL**:  
Integrates Flashlight, a C++ deep learning library, and was awarded second place.

## Presentations

**Krish**:  
Developer with experience in Web3 and AI, presented a project named DeDa

### DeDa Project

A decentralized data marketplace for AI and ML practitioners. Aims to solve the problem of high-quality, labeled data sets availability. Platform connects researchers and data publishers with validators ensuring data quality. Built using ICP with a backend in Rust and frontend as a canister.

## Discussion Points

### Data Verification

Current prototype has manual verification; future plans include automating this process with AI. Suggestions included starting with manual verification by researchers and evolving to software-based validation.

### Incentivization and Monetization

Incorporate token transfer for incentivization. Challenges in determining the cost of high-quality data sets and automating verification.

## Community and Support

Krish inquired about community support and mentoring. Recommendations included:
- Utilizing the decentralized AI channel on Discord.
- Joining weekly calls for knowledge exchange and technical support.
- Exploring programs like the Olympus accelerator and connecting with ICP hubs for growth and investment opportunities.

Thanh asked for a list of LLMs that you can run in an ICP canister smart contract

Referenced DeAI docs on ICP. Will update to include Llama 3 8b, Llama 2.

## Conclusion

Encouragement for ongoing participation and leveraging the community resources for development. Open invitation to join future calls and continue the knowledge exchange.
