# 2025.03.06 Meeting Summary - DeAI Working Group for the Internet Computer (ICP)

## Short Version
The discussion covered a review of ETH Denver. The ICP team engaged in AI and Bitcoin-related networking, highlighting strong developer interest in ZKPs, TEEs, and on-chain AI verification. AI agent discussions were mostly future-oriented, with Eliza as a key framework, while the Bitcoin community showed increasing interest in AI integrations. ICP submissions at the hackathon doubled, with the "Only Possible on ICP" track seeing the most engagement. Looking ahead, an ICP AI hackathon is being considered to better showcase its unique capabilities in the Web3 AI space.

## Long Version
## Discussion on Vitalik Buterin’s Article on AI
[Read the article](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2025/02/28/aihumans.html)

- Concerns were raised about the risks of centralized LLMs, even if they operate under decentralized interfaces.
- The need for truly decentralized AI architectures that fit within ICP was discussed.
- Future discussions will explore mechanisms to ensure decentralization.

## ETH Denver Review

### Side Events & Networking
- The ICP team engaged in AI and Bitcoin-related side events.
- ICP was represented at AI on-chain discussions, DeFi use cases, and AI agent implementations.

### Developer Engagement
- Strong interest in zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), trusted execution environments (TEEs), and alternative on-chain AI verification methods.
- Developers are still largely unaware of ICP’s capabilities, requiring better documentation and outreach.

### Bitcoin & AI Intersection
- Many discussions revolved around AI-powered trading strategies.
- Some projects explored LLM aggregators and AI privacy on Bitcoin.
- The Bitcoin community is showing growing interest in AI integrations.

### AI Agents & Decentralized AI Trends
- AI agent discussions were mostly future-focused, with few real-world applications currently in production.
- Eliza (AI agent framework) was the most commonly discussed framework, especially among crypto-native developers.

### B2C vs. B2B
- AI agent frameworks are mainly designed for B2C applications.
- Companies, on the other hand, are exploring internal AI-driven automation.

### Intellectual Property (IP) in AI
- A Story Protocol idea was discussed, suggesting AI agents could have “children” that inherit and monetize IP.

### Hackathon Takeaways
- ICP submissions doubled from last year.
- AI-related projects struggled to stand out due to the overlap of AI-focused bounties across multiple chains.
- ICP’s “Only Possible on ICP” track (e.g., Chain Fusion, on-chain randomness) saw the most engagement.
- Future ICP-led AI hackathons were proposed as a way to better highlight ICP’s unique capabilities.

## Future Initiatives
- The working group is considering organizing a dedicated ICP AI hackathon, potentially in San Francisco.
- Exploring ways to better differentiate ICP’s AI offerings in a crowded AI + Web3 space.
