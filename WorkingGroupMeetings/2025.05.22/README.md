# 2025.05.22 Meeting Summary - DeAI Working Group for the Internet Computer (ICP)

## Short Version
Today's DeAI Working Group call for the Internet Computer focused on evaluating GPU server configurations (e.g., Supermicro, Gigabyte) capable of supporting high-powered GPUs (up to 600 watts), discussing detailed documentation of AI model requirements for agentic AI, and emphasizing strategic alignment of infrastructure investments with clearly defined use cases and economic viability. The group explored targeted decentralized AI applications, recommending a focus on practical mid to small-scale models (â‰¤70B parameters). Next steps include collaboratively creating detailed comparison spreadsheets, initiating hardware tests, and formulating key strategic questions, alongside upcoming interactive sessions and workshops.

## Long Version
## Main Topics Discussed

### 1. GPU Infrastructure Evaluation

- Reviewed server chassis configurations suitable for GPU deployment, highlighting offerings from manufacturers such as Supermicro and Gigabyte.
- Emphasized chassis capable of supporting dual high-powered GPUs like NVIDIA's H100, H200, TensTorrent, and similar GPUs with power outputs up to 600 watts.
- Evaluated cost-effectiveness, noting that deploying a larger chassis (approx. USD$30,000 excluding GPUs) allows future expansion but significantly increases total cost when GPUs are added.

### 2. AI Compute Requirements

- Discussed the necessity of thoroughly documenting AI model requirements, such as memory usage, inference performance metrics, and optimal sizing for agentic AI applications.
- Proposed developing a structured, collaborative approach to identify and answer critical questions around model suitability and hardware capabilities, supported by scientific research.

### 3. Strategic Considerations

- Highlighted the need for clear justification of AI infrastructure investments based on well-defined use cases and realistic revenue-generating potential.
- Stressed alignment of infrastructure decisions with broader ICP platform goals, balancing technological capability with practical utility and economic sustainability.

### 4. Decentralized AI Use Cases

- Explored targeted use cases including decentralized AI agents for DeFi, productivity applications, management of sensitive personal data, and social interaction applications.
- Recommended focusing on mid to small-scale AI models (up to approximately 70 billion parameters) due to their practicality, ease of deployment, and suitability for specialized agentic tasks.

### 5. Next Steps and Action Items

- Initiate collaborative creation of detailed spreadsheets to systematically compare GPU hardware and AI model specifications.
- Plan initial practical tests with limited hardware (one or two servers) to validate and refine infrastructure choices.
- Next week's call will center on formulating precise questions to guide strategic infrastructure decisions and further refine the approach based on data-driven insights.

### 6. Upcoming Sessions and Collaborations

Planned sessions include:

- Workshop on AI4AI to drive strategic research
- Review and analysis of outcomes from the upcoming World Computer Summit.
- An interactive vibe coding session aimed at ICP development.
