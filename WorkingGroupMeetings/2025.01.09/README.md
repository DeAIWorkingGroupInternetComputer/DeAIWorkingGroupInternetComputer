## Long Version
# Summary of AI4AI on the Internet Computer (IC)

## Context and Purpose
The initiative AI4AI on the IC aims to develop a community-driven strategy for improving AI infrastructure on the Internet Computer (IC), enhancing its ability to run decentralized AI workloads. The focus is on fostering collaboration between DFINITY, community teams, node providers, and developers to align efforts and establish a robust AI ecosystem.

## Key Goals

### Roadmap Development:
- Create a living, community-maintained roadmap for AI infrastructure development on the IC, aligned with DFINITY's roadmap for 2025-26.
- Focus on identifying and addressing AI infrastructure requirements and maintaining progress documentation.

### Fostering Collaboration:
- Host monthly open meetings via the DeAI Technical Working Group (TWG) to align community efforts.
- Encourage contributions from node providers, developers, and Web3 collaborators.
- Promote existing achievements while identifying gaps for growth.

## Hardware Infrastructure

### Current and Proposed Node Specifications:
- **Gen 1 and 2 Nodes:** Limited or no GPU capabilities; designed with AMD EPYC CPUs and PCIe 4.0.
- **Proposed Gen 3 Nodes (2025/26):**
  - Advanced AMD EPYC CPUs with PCIe 5.0.
  - Support for full-length, double-width GPUs with a higher power rating (300W TDP).

### AI Accelerators:
- Emphasis on flexible hardware specifications for compatibility with diverse GPU vendors (e.g., NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, and emerging providers like Tenstorrent).
- Consideration for open-source or partially open-source software stacks for transparency and efficiency.

## Software Infrastructure

### AI Inference on the IC:
- **Synchronous Inference:** Current models run within IC node CPUs using WebAssembly (WASM).
- **Asynchronous Inference:** Proposed mechanisms for GPU integration and API-based interactions for enhanced performance.

### Specialized AI Subnets:
- Exploration of subnets dedicated to AI workloads, tailored for specific hardware configurations (e.g., "AI-as-a-Service").

### Edge and IoT Integration:
- Extend IC capabilities to edge devices for real-time AI applications, such as environmental monitoring with IoT sensors.

## Development Principles

### Openness and Standards:
- Adhere to open hardware standards (e.g., PCIe, RISC-V) and open-source software principles.
- Leverage community collaboration for transparency and inclusivity.

### Privacy, Security, and Sovereignty:
- Promote privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) in hardware and software choices.
- Ensure secure execution under consensus and document potential privacy trade-offs.

## Long-Term Vision
Transform IC into a decentralized hub for AI, enabling:
- Storage and orchestration of AI models.
- Secure, on-chain model inference and training.
- Integration with diverse hardware and software ecosystems.

Maintain simplicity and flexibility to support various AI workloads while prioritizing energy efficiency, scalability, and a seamless developer experience.

## Next Steps and Action Items
- Migrate to the new IC Discord server with improved management tools.
- Engage community members to contribute to the hardware roadmap and identify collaboration opportunities.
- Plan for deeper discussions on hardware specifications in upcoming meetings.
- Facilitate demonstrations and foster knowledge sharing through scheduled sessions.

## Conclusion
AI4AI on the IC represents a collaborative push toward scalable, decentralized AI infrastructure, emphasizing community ownership, openness, and alignment with emerging technological standards. By fostering a collaborative ecosystem, the initiative positions the IC as a pioneering platform for on-chain AI.
