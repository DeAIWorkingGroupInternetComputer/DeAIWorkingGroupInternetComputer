# 2024.12.19 Meeting Summary - DeAI Working Group for the Internet Computer (ICP)

## Short Version
The session emphasized the importance of structured collaboration, active outreach, and community-driven innovation to advance decentralized AI on the Internet Computer. Key initiatives include engaging external AI projects, fostering cross-ecosystem integration, scheduling regular "State of DeAI" calls, and enhancing accessibility through diverse platforms. Plans involve creating a central GitHub knowledge repository, authoring biannual "State of Decentralized AI" reports, and aligning on a refined AI strategy. Event participation, such as ETHDenver, will focus on predefined collaboration structures and follow-ups. Regular feedback loops and decentralized coordination will guide ongoing efforts to position ICP as a leader in blockchain AI.

## Long Version
# Enhancing Collaborations

## Engagement with External Projects:
- Members emphasized the need to involve projects from outside the ICP ecosystem, offering demos or topic-specific presentations.
- Encouraging collaboration with AI projects, such as those developing frameworks like Eliza, was proposed.

## Cross-Ecosystem Integration:
- Utilizing partnerships with entities like Bitcoin and AI Labs, and engaging projects at events like ETHDenver, was suggested.

# Structuring Sessions and Outreach

## Regular Sessions:
- Proposed scheduling quarterly "State of DeAI" calls to share updates, achievements, and progress within the ecosystem.
- Structured sessions around demos, technical discussions, and strategy brainstorming.

## Event Coordination:
- For events like ETHDenver, the group plans to prepare predefined collaboration structures to attract partnerships.

## Improving Accessibility:
- Utilizing various platforms (e.g., Discord, Twitter Spaces) based on the preferences of collaborators to maximize outreach.

# AI Strategy and New Hires

## DFINITY Team Expansion:
- New hires in AI Strategy Management, AI Business Development, and a new AI/ML engineer for the languages team.
- These additions aim to strengthen AI strategy, execution, and integration across ICP-related projects.

## AI Roadmap:
- A proposal for a structured AI strategy session early in the new year to align with new team members and refine priorities.

# Knowledge Management and Publications

## Central Repository:
- Members agreed to create a GitHub-based knowledge repository in the existing repo: [DeAIWorkingGroupInternetComputer](https://github.com/DeAIWorkingGroupInternetComputer/DeAIWorkingGroupInternetComputer), enabling easy sharing of ideas, updates, and meeting summaries.
- A "community notes" section was suggested for informal contributions.

## Collaborative Papers:
- Discussed authoring a biannual "State of Decentralized AI" report to establish ICP as a thought leader in blockchain AI. These reports would include cutting-edge research and practical applications.

# Conference Participation

## Goals for Events:
- Engage attendees from conferences like ETHDenver in concrete collaborations.
- Propose follow-up sessions (e.g., pitch days) post-conferences to maintain engagement.

# Governance and Process

## Regular Feedback Loops:
- Proposed maintaining regular contact with ICP projects working on AI to gather updates and inform strategy.

## Decentralized Coordination:
- Encouraging contributions through structured agendas while allowing flexibility for informal input.

# Next Steps

- Finalize the schedule for January sessions focused on strategy and team introductions.
- Define a standardized process for outreach and collaboration at major events.
- Set up and promote the GitHub repository for community contributions and centralized information sharing.

This session underscored the importance of structured collaboration, active outreach, and community-driven innovation to advance decentralized AI on the Internet Computer.
