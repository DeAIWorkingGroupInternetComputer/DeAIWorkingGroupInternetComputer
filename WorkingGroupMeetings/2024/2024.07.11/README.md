# 2024.07.11 Meeting Summary - DeAI Working Group for the Internet Computer (ICP)

## Short Version
In today's DeAI Working Group call, Vincent presented his master thesis work, focusing on encryption and machine learning models deployed on the Internet Computer, sharing a prototype link (https://zvrui-xqaaa-aaaao-a3pbq-cai.icp0.io/) and the code repository (https://github.com/vince2git/ic-secure-ml). Key discussions covered encryption key exchanges, secure data handling, and using the linfa rust library for benchmarking machine learning models. Vincent detailed the architecture involving t-SNE for clustering and neural network training on the MNIST dataset. Icarus shared insights from the Node provider ICP lab event in Zurich, discussing hardware options, including AMD CPUs with SIMD extensions and integrated CPU-GPU architectures for AI on the IC blockchain (https://forum.dfinity.org/t/technical-working-group-node-providers/30255/7?u=icarus). Challenges of accessing GPU functionality from the WASM runtime and potential solutions through host functions were explored. Future directions emphasized collaboration between node providers and Dfinity engineers, forming a working group to focus on accelerated hardware integration. Open discussions addressed hardware setups, high-level host functions, ONNX for AI model deployment, and the importance of supporting frameworks like PyTorch. Community involvement was encouraged to share benchmarks, explore parallelism, and contribute to ongoing discussions for collective problem-solving.

## Long Version

## Vincent's Presentation on Encryption and Machine Learning Models

## Introduction and Welcome
- Vincent presented his work for his master thesis.
- Shared a link to a prototype deployed on the Internet Computer: [Prototype](https://zvrui-xqaaa-aaaao-a3pbq-cai.icp0.io/) (code: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/vince2git/ic-secure-ml))

## Key Topics Discussed

### Encryption Key Exchange
- Initial steps involve exchanging public keys between the client and the canister for secure communication.
