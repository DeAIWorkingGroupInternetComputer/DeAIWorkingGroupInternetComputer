# 2024.01.04 Meeting Summary - DeAI Working Group for the Internet Computer (ICP)

## Introductions and Project Overviews
Several individuals introduce themselves and describe their specific areas of interest or projects they’re working on. This includes work on IoT, ICP (Internet Computer Protocol), AI, NLP (Natural Language Processing), and more.

## Utilization of Tools and Platforms
The conversation kicks off with acknowledgments of the existing tools and platforms and how participants are engaging with them.

## Blockers and Challenges
Participants discuss current challenges, such as instruction limits and memory constraints in AI development, and how these might be affecting their projects.

## Technical Solutions and Ideas
There’s an in-depth technical discussion about potential solutions to the challenges presented, including using specialized subnets for latency-sensitive applications, utilizing stable memory for large model weights, and the impact of instruction limits on AI capabilities.

## Community and Action Items
The group also talks about leveraging forums and other community platforms to discuss these issues more broadly and gather support. They propose creating threads to discuss specific problems like instruction limits and memory issues.

## Timeliness and Efficiency
There’s a concern about the timeliness of responses, especially in voice applications, and how latency can affect user experience. The importance of balancing speed and accuracy in AI responses is highlighted.

## Future Directions and Queries
The conversation turns to the future, considering how new features like websockets might influence development and the potential for continually evolving infrastructure to meet AI needs.

## Integration of GPUs in Nodes for AI
The participants discuss the potential and challenges of integrating GPUs into the nodes of the network to facilitate more robust AI and machine learning tasks. They explore the implications, including the technical feasibility, consensus mechanism modifications, and the significant cost associated with high-end GPUs.

## Data Privacy and Security
The conversation also focuses on ensuring stringent data privacy and security measures. Participants express the need to adhere to strict data regulations like the EU’s and discuss using cryptographic keys and client-side encryption to enhance user data security. They emphasize the user’s ownership and control over their data and the platform’s inability to access or share this data without consent.

## Technical and Financial Implications
There’s a detailed discussion about the technical roadmap, the financial implications of adding GPUs to the nodes (referred to as Gen. 3 specs), and the need for replicated compute across nodes. The need for transparency in the development process and a clear understanding of the costs involved is highlighted.

## Community Involvement and Feedback
The participants mention the importance of community involvement, brainstorming sessions, and feedback mechanisms. They discuss using Discord channels and forums for ongoing discussion and updates, reflecting a collaborative approach to problem-solving and innovation.
