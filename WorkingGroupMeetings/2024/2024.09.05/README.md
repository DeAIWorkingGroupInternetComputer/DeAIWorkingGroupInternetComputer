# 2024.09.05 Meeting Summary - DeAI Working Group for the Internet Computer (ICP)

## Short Version
In today's DeAI Working Group call for the Internet Computer, discussions centered on AI development with a focus on large language models (LLMs), vector databases, and decentralized AI applications. Key insights included the development of personal AI systems using secure, tamper-proof vector databases on the blockchain, offering users control over their own models and data, avoiding centralized data collection risks. The group emphasized optimizing LLMs like LLaMA for specific tasks such as email search and educational tools. They also explored the potential for a decentralized marketplace for AI models, enabling secure monetization of AI contributions on the ICP platform, with a long-term vision similar to Hugging Face, enhanced by blockchain features.

## Long Version
In today's call of the DeAI Working Group for the Internet Computer, the key topics revolved around AI development, focusing on large language models (LLMs), vector databases, and decentralized AI applications. The discussion highlighted a range of technical and product development insights, including:

**Personal AI and Vector Databases:** There was significant focus on creating personal AI systems using vector databases that are tamper-proof and secure. The group explored the idea of having users manage their own AI models and data securely on the blockchain, avoiding the risks of centralized data collection by companies like OpenAI. The vector database being developed by Kinic allows for updates, inserts, and deletes, a key innovation over previous non-updatable systems.

**AI for Specific Use Cases:** The conversation stressed the importance of focusing on clear, specific use cases for AI deployment, particularly in areas like personal email search or company document management.

**Security and Decentralization:** Participants discussed how decentralized AI solutions can compete with centralized providers by offering more control over personal data. This was seen as a critical differentiator in the future of AI, allowing users to keep sensitive information private while still benefiting from AI technologies.

**Optimization and Inference on the Internet Computer:** The team is exploring ways to optimize LLMs for inference on the Internet Computer. They are looking into models like LLaMA and considering fine-tuning them for specific tasks, such as generating custom math problems for educational purposes. There was also interest in developing a data economy around these models, enabling researchers and developers to monetize their AI contributions.

**Marketplace for AI Models:** The idea of creating an LLM marketplace on the Internet Computer was discussed. This platform would allow users to upload, sell, and buy models optimized for various use cases, with security and trust built into the blockchain infrastructure. The long-term vision includes creating a comprehensive marketplace akin to Hugging Face but with added blockchain features for trust and security.
