# 2024.03.07 Meeting Summary - DeAI Working Group for the Internet Computer (ICP)

## Short Version

[Massimo](https://forum.dfinity.org/u/massimoalbarello/summary) showcased the project he and [Luca](https://forum.dfinity.org/u/ilbert/summary) have been working on aimed at [enabling DAOs to manage off-chain web3 services](https://github.com/omnia-network/ic_akash) through an orchestrator canister on the ICP, focusing on decentralizing control and ensuring transparency by potentially governing it through a DAO. The project, still in early stages, looks to facilitate deployment on networks like Akash.

The discussion extended to integrating AI infrastructure on the ICP, highlighting the technical challenges of creating GPU subnets and decentralizing AI service management to enhance the platform's capabilities. Key topics included the complexity of managing resources across different networks, the engineering hurdles in GPU design for AI, the significance of a DAO gateway as a bridge to external compute resources, and the importance of confidential computing for off-chain AI models.

Future directions involve exploring GPU-enabled VMs secured by confidential computing, ensuring payments in ICP, and fostering a community-driven approach to development. A forthcoming joint meeting with the Scalability Group aims to delve into scalability issues, indicating an interest in collaborative efforts to address the challenges of decentralized AI and performance on the ICP.

## Long Version

[Massimo](https://forum.dfinity.org/u/massimoalbarello/summary) introduced the project he and [Luca](https://forum.dfinity.org/u/ilbert/summary) have been working on focused on [off-chain infrastructure integration with the ICP](https://github.com/omnia-network/ic_akash), highlighting the challenge decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) face in controlling off-chain services essential for web3 functionalities. He detailed the concept of an orchestrator canister that would allow DAOs to deploy and manage off-chain services on networks like Akash through ICP, aiming to decentralize control over such services further. The project, still in early development, intends to eventually be governed by a DAO to ensure transparency and trust in its operations.

The conversation also touched upon the technicalities and potential of integrating AI infrastructure on the ICP, discussing the creation of GPU subnets and the technical challenges involved. They explored the idea of decentralizing the deployment and management of off-chain AI services, thereby enhancing the capabilities of the ICP in the AI domain while maintaining decentralization principles.
Complexity Within the Orchestrator: This part starts with an acknowledgment of the inherent complexity within the orchestrator, especially in relation to deploying instances on various networks. The complexity is attributed to the network-specific metrics, highlighting the challenge of managing resources efficiently across different blockchain environments.

Engineering Challenges: A significant portion of the discussion focuses on the engineering challenges associated with GPU node design and the architecture for decentralized AI. There's a consensus on the magnitude of these challenges, emphasizing the need for substantial effort to address them.

Bridge to Open Clouds: The participants discuss the concept of a DAO gateway as a bridge to open clouds and other infrastructure, underscoring its value in leveraging the vast processing power of public clouds for decentralized AI applications. This bridge is viewed as crucial for maintaining pace with advancements in AI technology outside the decentralized framework.

Integration with External Services: The group talks about the importance of integrating with external networks to access additional compute resources, acknowledging that while the Internet Computer provides a robust platform, it cannot operate in isolation from the technological developments happening outside its ecosystem.

Confidential Computing: There is a mention of confidential computing and the challenges of running AI models off-chain while maintaining the privacy and security standards of the on-chain environment. The discussion points out the limitations of current services in offering guarantees similar to those on the Internet Computer.

Future Directions and Integrations: Towards the end, there's a forward-looking conversation about the potential for new integrations and services that could support decentralized AI, including verifiable compute infrastructure and the use of trusted execution environments. The participants express a desire for a solution that feels deeply integrated with the Internet Computer, rather than a superficial connection with external services.

Exploration of GPU-Enabled VMs: The discussion revolves around the potential for repurposing boundary node services for GPU-enabled VMs, keeping compute resources closer to the Internet Computer blockchain. This approach aims to leverage confidential computing and Trusted Execution Environments to secure services while allowing payment in ICP, maintaining a trustless environment.

Payment in ICP and Known Parties: The conversation touches on the benefits of having known parties and node providers within the IC ecosystem to facilitate trustless transactions and secure services. The possibility of paying for GPU-enabled services in ICP without exchanging tokens is highlighted as an advantage.

Community Collaboration: The call concludes with an open invitation for collaboration and knowledge sharing among the participants. There's an interest in compiling a list of networks providing GPU compute resources, as well as a call for sharing benchmarks and statistics to better understand the needs and limitations of AI services on the Internet Computer.

Joint Meeting with Scalability Group: The group discusses an upcoming joint meeting with the scalability group, emphasizing the importance of preparing questions and research topics related to scalability issues previously touched upon. The aim is to enhance understanding and collaboration between the two groups.

Future Topics and Collaboration: There's an open call for suggestions on future topics of interest to members' projects or general curiosity. The goal is to tailor the group's agenda to the needs and interests of its members, ensuring valuable and relevant discussions.

Interest in Scalability and Performance: The group expresses interest in further discussions on scalability and performance, suggesting joint sessions with the Scalability and Performance group to leverage expertise and explore common topics of interest.
