## Long Version
The DeAI Working Group call on August 22, 2024, primarily focused on several key topics:

**Marketing Promotion for Anniversary:**  
The group discussed a marketing initiative to celebrate the one-year anniversary of running large language models (LLMs) on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). Members were encouraged to share their achievements and future goals to create a promotional template.

**Project Overviews:**  
A significant portion of the call was dedicated to reviewing various AI projects and tools built on ICP. These included different AI models and frameworks categorized by language (e.g., TypeScript, Python, C++, Motoko, and Rust). Notable projects included Tensorflow integration, large language models like LLaMA, and vector databases.

**Documentation and Resources:**  
There was a discussion about improving the organization and accessibility of resources, such as project repositories, toolkits, and documentation. The group considered syncing the DeAI working group's resources with the larger ICP community resources, like the "Awesome ICP" repository, to avoid redundancy.

**Training Data and Model Transparency:**  
Participants expressed interest in curating and sharing open and verifiable training data sources, especially given the recent restrictions on data crawling by many websites. There was also discussion about the importance of understanding what data models are trained on to maintain transparency and build trustworthy AI systems.

**Future Meeting Topics:**  
The group agreed on the importance of further discussions on training data, model transparency, and enhancing AI on ICP through more specialized tools and curated datasets.
