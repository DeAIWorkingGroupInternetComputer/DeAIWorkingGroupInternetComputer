# 2024.06.06 Meeting Summary - DeAI Working Group for the Internet Computer (ICP)

## Short Version
The DeAI Working Group call for the Internet Computer focused on improving AI project marketing and documentation and was a joined session with DFINITY team members across growth, marketing and adoption. Participants discussed the need for better marketing strategies, comprehensive AI documentation, and practical use cases to demonstrate ICP's benefits. Collaborative efforts were emphasized, including creating a decentralized AI manifesto, collecting success stories, and exploring monthly public updates. The call concluded with actionable steps to support ecosystem teams, enhance marketing resources, and ensure the successful promotion of decentralized AI on the Internet Computer.


## Long Version
Introduction and Participants:
- The call began with introductions from various team members.
Key participants included members from the DFINITY growth, marketing, and adoption teams, as well as those involved in AI projects on ICP.
- Notable introductions were from Jennifer (growth team), Radu (Dev Partner Manager at Dfinity), Kyle (data analytics and marketing), Jesse (technical writer at Dfinity), Shashi (adoption team), and other ecosystem team members.

Objectives and Current Projects:
- The focus is on understanding how AI products can market themselves on ICP.
Jennifer emphasized the goal of amplifying the DeAI narrative on ICP, particularly within the developer ecosystem.
- Radu discussed his role in supporting startups and projects, including hosting the DeAI Live series.
Jesse highlighted the current state of AI documentation, mentioning the need for more comprehensive resources and examples (https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/ai/overview).

Project Updates:
- Participants shared updates on their projects. For instance, Patrick introduced DeVinci, a decentralized AI chat app, and discussed collaboration with Arjaan (icpp) on a platform for creating on-chain or on-device AI solutions.
- Icarus, a node provider from Australia, discussed the importance of bridging the gap towards accelerated hardware (GPUs) for AI on ICP.
- Michael, working on DAI Chat, shared the challenges in understanding the technical limits of the ICP and their efforts to host large language models on the platform.

Marketing and Documentation Needs:
- There was a discussion on the need for better marketing strategies for AI projects, particularly for developers who lack marketing expertise.
- Participants pointed out the necessity for clearer documentation regarding the technical capabilities and limitations of ICP, such as heap size, stable memory size, and computation time.

Collaborative Efforts and Action Items:
- The group discussed the possibility of merging efforts to create a comprehensive repository for AI on ICP, which would serve as a resource for new developers.
Jesse proposed creating a rough outline for AI documentation, which would be reviewed and revised in subsequent meetings.
- The group agreed to work collaboratively to fill in documentation gaps, ensuring resources are available for developers with different backgrounds (e.g., Python, JavaScript).

Discussion on Documentation and Feedback:
- The meeting started with a discussion on the upcoming rough outline for AI trends in the industry and how they intersect with ICP (Internet Computer Protocol). The goal is to gather feedback and revisions on this outline, focusing on what to add or remove based on current AI trends and specific ICP considerations from a developer's perspective.
- There was a consensus on the importance of sharing this outline and receiving feedback to coalesce around the group's focus.

Sharing and Collaboration:
- A thread will be initiated in the working group's usual channel for members to suggest additions or revisions to the documentation. This is to ensure comprehensive coverage of all relevant aspects and to include input from new projects or overlooked areas (https://discord.com/channels/748416164832608337/1184160869614108873/1248313980913451079).

Marketing and Outreach:
- The group brainstormed on improving the marketing of decentralized AI (DeAI) on ICP. Suggestions included outlining a more detailed roadmap and exploring other ideas for marketing support.
Practical use cases and success stories were highlighted as essential for promoting DeAI, with a focus on demonstrating real-world applications and benefits, particularly around privacy and security.

Specific Use Cases and Integration:
- Discussion on the need to drill down on specific use cases, providing concrete numbers to illustrate the cost-effectiveness and benefits of using AI on ICP compared to traditional infrastructures.
The potential for companies to run private models more cost-effectively on the Internet Computer was discussed, highlighting the advantages of not storing user data and only paying per usage.

Manifesto and Monthly Updates:
- A suggestion was made to create a manifesto for decentralizing AI, which would outline the principles and reasons for this approach, providing a focused marketing tool. This manifesto should be nuanced and not overly biased towards ICP to maintain credibility.
- The idea of a monthly "state of DeAI" call was proposed, where community wins and technical updates could be shared, potentially in a public format like a Twitter space.

Support for Ecosystem Teams:
- The importance of helping smaller, early-stage projects with their marketing plans was emphasized, recognizing that these teams might lack the necessary expertise.
- DFINITY's role in supporting these projects through PR, networking, and potentially marketing grants was discussed. The possibility of creating a process for sharing go-to-market strategies within the community was also considered.

Next Steps:
The group agreed on several action items:
- Collect and publish success stories of on-chain AI as quick wins.
- Draft a decentralized AI manifesto, potentially starting with a one-pager.
- Explore the idea of a monthly public call or Twitter space to share updates and community wins.
- Revamp the PR handbook to include more resources for marketing support.
- Continue supporting ecosystem teams through existing and new initiatives, ensuring they have the necessary tools and guidance for successful marketing and outreach.

Overall, the meeting emphasized collaboration, practical applications, and strategic marketing to promote the development and adoption of decentralized AI on the Internet Computer.
