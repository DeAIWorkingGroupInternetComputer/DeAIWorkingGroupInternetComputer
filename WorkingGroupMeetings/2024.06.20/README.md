# 2024.06.20 Meeting Summary - DeAI Working Group for the Internet Computer (ICP)

## Short Version
In today's call of the Decentralized AI Working Group for the Internet Computer (IC), discussions focused on enhancing developer documentation and planning future topics. The group emphasized creating structured AI documentation with sections on overview, workflows, tooling resources, and examples to meet developers’ specific goals. They discussed content suggestions, encouraging developer contributions, and aligning documentation with industry standards and ICP capabilities. Technical considerations included merging machine learning and inference workflows and detailing current and future capabilities to set expectations. Innovative AI concepts and iterative improvements based on feedback were highlighted. Future topics will cover current and future AI capabilities, speculative AI model re-architecting, regulatory impacts, and comparative analysis with similar projects. Action items include revising and posting the documentation outline for feedback, and planning discussions on GPU determinism, LLM sizes on ICP, training data pathways, and global AI governance regulations.

## Long Version
Today’s call of the Decentralized AI  Working Group for the IC covered two main sections: the developer documentation and future topics.

### Developer Documentation Discussion:
#### Goal and Structure:
- Aim to create AI documentation that caters to developers’ needs by providing a structured overview, specific workflows, tooling information, and implementation examples.
- Developers typically visit documentation with specific goals, so pages should align with their expected workflows and current capabilities.
- Documentation to be divided into sections: overview, AI workflows, tooling resources, and detailed workflow implementation examples.

#### Content Suggestions:
- Include examples like vector databases and other AI-related tools and workflows developers might use.
- Have developers contribute specific documentation pages or examples they have experience with.
- Encourage developer ownership of documentation pages for specific examples or projects.

#### Workflow Focus:
- Developers should get a high-level insight into DeAI on ICP, understand AI workflows, access tooling resources, and find implementation examples.
- Ensure documentation aligns with industry terminology and current ICP capabilities.

#### Technical and Future Considerations:
- Combine machine learning and inference workflows into a single category if technically appropriate.
- Include details about current and future capabilities to set realistic expectations for developers.
- Explain limitations and future improvements in one centralized page, with pointers to more detailed sections.

#### Innovative AI Concepts:
- Discuss new AI models and emerging technologies like neuromorphic chips and spiking neural networks.

#### Collaborative and Incremental Improvements:
- Maintain an iterative approach to improving documentation based on community feedback and evolving technology.
- Keep the content up-to-date with incremental updates reflecting new capabilities and best practices.

### Future Topics and Feedback:
#### Current and Future Capabilities:
- Highlight current limitations and future improvements in AI on ICP, such as memory limits and upcoming GPU support.
- Provide a timeline for expected improvements and new features.
- Explore speculative ideas for re-architecting AI models to better fit ICP’s architecture and performance characteristics.

#### Regulatory and Governance Issues:
- Discuss the impact of AI regulations, particularly the EU AI Act, on AI development and deployment.
- Explore decentralized AI governance and potential synergies with other Web3 projects.

#### Comparative Analysis:
- Compare ICP's AI capabilities with similar projects to understand architectural differences and potential advantages.
- Present insights into how other platforms approach AI and explore opportunities for collaboration.

### Action Items:
- Revise the documentation outline based on the discussed structure and focus.
- Post the revised outline in the Discord channel and the working group forum for additional feedback.
- Plan to discuss GPU determinism, realistic LLM sizes on ICP, and training data pathways in the next meeting.
- Prepare for a session on global AI governance regulations, with members contributing insights from different regions.
