# 2025.01.02 Meeting Summary - DeAI Working Group for the Internet Computer (ICP)

## Short Version
The working group identified key goals and topics of interest going into 2025. Plans include expanding collaborations with Web3 and AI ecosystems, improving developer resources through tutorials and bounties, and fostering cross-community engagement. Regular sessions and publications, such as a "State of DeAI" update, will showcase progress and ecosystem advancements. Notable discussions focused on integrating AR and AI into decentralized applications, addressing technical challenges, and highlighting opportunities for cross-ecosystem compatibility. Upcoming sessions aim to explore infrastructure, partnerships, on-chain LLMs, and the DeAI manifesto.

## Long Version

## Infrastructure Enhancements:
- Recognized limitations of ICP (Internet Computer Protocol) in handling large files and GPU-based computation.
- Consideration of partnerships with ecosystems like Swarm or building solutions in-house for file storage and GPU hardware.
- Need for ICP to evolve into an orchestration layer integrating adjacent services.

## Collaborations and Outreach:
- Proposed outreach to broader Web3 and AI ecosystems, including ETH AI Center and partnerships with research institutions (e.g., Stanford).
- Encouragement for cross-community collaboration to raise awareness and expand ICPâ€™s application space.

## Documentation and Tutorials:
- Emphasis on improving developer resources and tutorials, targeting at least one tutorial/documentation piece per month.
- Suggested bounties or ecosystem partnerships to accelerate documentation creation.

## Regular Publications and Sessions:
- Proposal for a quarterly "State of DeAI" publication to summarize progress and showcase ecosystem advancements.
- Plan for regular sessions, including a hardware-focused discussion, a state-of-the-art session on on-chain LLMs, and a session on the DeAI manifesto.

## Community Engagement:
- Discussed strategies to encourage participation from developers and projects to share their progress and challenges more openly.
- Suggested direct outreach and dedicated invites to increase attendance in specific sessions.

## Augmented Reality (AR) and AI Integration:
- Explored use cases of AR integrated with AI, including an augmented art gallery and an AR-based decentralized game.
- Noted challenges with AR's current experimental stage, including browser compatibility issues.
- Discussed potential for ICP and Swarm to complement AR applications by managing data and contracts.

## Future Sessions:
- Planned sessions include:
  - Hardware and infrastructure session (mid-January).
  - Collaboration with DFINITY AI team (January 16).
  - State of on-chain LLMs session (late January/early February).
  - Twitter Space on the DeAI manifesto (late January/early February).

## Action Points:
- Organize targeted outreach for upcoming sessions and engage specific communities (e.g., Swarm, ETH AI).
- Push forward on tutorials/documentation and consider bounties for ecosystem contributions.
- Continue exploring opportunities for showcasing cross-ecosystem integration, especially highlighting the compatibility of ICP with other Web3 tools.
- Follow up with ai16z contacts to explore potential collaborative sessions.
