# 2024.02.29 Meeting Summary - DeAI Working Group for the Internet Computer (ICP)

Today's call was more informal as we were a smaller group. We thus mostly talked about the projects we’re working on.

These are some specific notes relevant for future calls:
- Interest was expressed in talking more about how external computing resources (i.e. outside the IC network, like dedicated GPU networks or traditional cloud service providers) could be integrated and complement the infrastructure available to IC devs in their projects.
- Concerning the different performance bottlenecks we’ve been talking about as a group (e.g. instruction limits, memory, GPU), it was proposed that we could discuss a divide-and-conquer approach where we collaborate as a group and members contribute by running different experiments around the performance metrics. 
- For benchmarking, we could use a recently released tool for IC canisters ([GitHub - dfinity/canbench: A benchmarking framework for canisters on the Internet Computer](https://github.com/dfinity/canbench/)),
- and then put the different experiment results into the benchmarking section in our DeAI repo ([DeAIWorkingGroupInternetComputer/BenchmarkingStats at main · DeAIWorkingGroupInternetComputer/DeAIWorkingGroupInternetComputer · GitHub](https://github.com/DeAIWorkingGroupInternetComputer/DeAIWorkingGroupInternetComputer/tree/main/BenchmarkingStats))

Please let us know which future topics you’d like to see on the agenda and which type of calls you’d like to have.
