# 2024.07.25 Meeting Summary - DeAI Working Group for the Internet Computer (ICP)

## Short Version
DFINITY is expanding its AI team by hiring an AI engineer specializing in GPU optimizations and deep learning libraries to work alongside the current team member, Islam, who has extensive experience in the Internet Computer (IC) and AI. The DeAI group discussed networking to find suitable candidates and expressed enthusiasm for the new role. The team is transitioning with the help of Ulan, planning milestones for GPU and CPU optimizations on IC, and working on various demos such as face recognition and GPT. Members shared interests in decentralized AI and gaming applications. Tim presented Hypercerts from Protocol Labs, which use semi-fungible certificates to incentivize and validate impact in projects like public goods and environmental remediation. The group discussed future collaborations, emphasizing decentralized AI development and community-driven efforts. Action items include sharing the job opening, continuing demo development, and exploring Hypercerts' applications in AI projects.

## Long Version

# Key Points:

## Opening Remarks and DFINITY AI Team Expansion:
The group discussed that DFINITY is hiring an AI engineer with expertise in GPU optimizations, deep learning libraries, and ideally someone who has contributed to such libraries. This is to complement the existing team member, who has extensive knowledge of the Internet Computer (IC).

## AI Team Introduction:
Islam, the current team member, with a background in IC and experience in AI (specifically recommendation systems), introduced himself and shared his past work at Twitter and a startup.

## Collaboration and Networking:
Members discussed sharing the job opening within their networks to find suitable candidates. They emphasized the excitement and potential of this new role.

## Team Transition and Roadmap:
The AI team is transitioning into their new roles with the help of Ulan and others. They are planning the next milestones for enabling GPU optimizations on IC and exploring more immediate CPU optimizations.

## Ongoing Projects and Demos:
Several demos were mentioned, including face recognition, GPT, and speech recognition. These demos are part of exploring the capabilities of the current IC infrastructure.

## Community Interests and Introductions:
Members introduced themselves, sharing their interests in decentralized AI, game AI, and general AI applications. There was a focus on the potential of using AI in gaming for dialogue improvements and dynamic story arcs.

## Hypercerts Presentation by Tim:
Tim presented on Hypercerts, a concept from Protocol Labs, which involves using flexible, semi-fungible certificates to incentivize and validate impact in projects, particularly in public goods and environmental remediation.
Hypercerts are designed to provide retroactive public goods funding and allow for flexible bundling and unbundling of impact scopes.
Examples included ecosystem remediation projects in Brazil and the use of AI for impact assessment.

## Future Plans and Collaboration Opportunities:
The group discussed potential collaborations, especially in using Hypercerts for contributions in collaborative AI projects.
The importance of aligning AI development with decentralized principles and community-driven efforts was highlighted.

## Action Items:
- Share the job opening for the DFINITY AI engineer role within personal networks.
- Continue developing and sharing demos and projects within the group.
- Engage with Hypercerts and consider their application in collaborative AI projects.
