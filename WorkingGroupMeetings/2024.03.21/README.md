## Long Version

Utilization of AI Models on the Blockchain: The group discussed the potential to support various AI models both on-chain and side-chain, including leveraging ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) format for interoperability of AI models across different platforms.

ONNX Runtime: Attention was given to the ONNX runtime, an open-source project that provides an inference engine for ONNX models. This runtime can facilitate the deployment of AI models, making them more accessible to developers on the Internet Computer platform.

Common Tooling for Development: The importance of developing common tooling and protocols for building applications on the Internet Computer was highlighted. This includes creating a standardized approach for describing data and models, as well as runtime environments, to facilitate the development of decentralized applications (dApps).

Federated Learning: The group discussed the application of federated learning, which allows for collaborative training of models while keeping user data private. This approach is facilitated by the unique architecture of the Internet Computer and can be enhanced by using the ONNX format for model sharing and interoperability.

Incentivization and Tokenomics: There was a discussion on how the Internet Computer's native token and blockchain structure could incentivize participation in a decentralized AI model training and application ecosystem. This could include rewarding users for contributing to model training or providing computational resources.

Interoperability and Standards: The emphasis on using standards like ONNX was seen as crucial for ensuring interoperability between different systems and models. This can significantly enhance the ecosystem's growth by allowing for seamless integration and use of diverse AI models and tools.

Future Directions and Projects: The group discussed various future directions and potential projects, including the use of AI in the Metaverse and intelligent agents, emphasizing the need for continued collaboration and standardization to realize these ambitions.

This section of the call focuses on discussions about the development and utilization of GPU subnets within the Internet Computer ecosystem, highlighting the challenges in gathering information and coordinating development efforts. Participants express frustration over the opacity surrounding GPU-enabled networks and the difficulty in obtaining information beyond sporadic tweets and articles. The conversation reveals a desire for more transparency and better communication channels to understand what specific models or projects are being worked on and how they can contribute or collaborate effectively.

There's an acknowledgment of the challenges in making GPU resources available and transparent for development purposes. The discussion underscores the importance of understanding the specifics of what's being developed and how it aligns with the group's capabilities and resources. There's a consensus on the need for clearer communication and collaboration between developers, node providers, and the DFINITY Foundation to ensure that efforts are complementary and not duplicative.

Participants discuss strategies for better coordination and information sharing, including the possibility of using forum threads for broader community engagement and feedback. The conversation highlights a keen interest in pushing the capabilities of the Internet Computer, especially regarding large-scale and complex computational tasks that could benefit from GPU acceleration. There's an acknowledgment that while the Internet Computer is still in its early stages, it possesses the potential to evolve significantly with collaborative efforts and community input.

This part delved into a variety of technical discussions about computing, data formats, protocols, and the integration of specialized hardware with the Internet Computer (IC). The participants discussed the importance of common data formats and protocols for efficient interaction with services, emphasizing the concept of treating compute as serverless, where jobs are sent off for execution on specialized hardware and the results are integrated back onto the blockchain.

A significant portion of the conversation revolved around the concept of "utopia" subnets, which allow for the creation of private, decentralized clouds or subnets that can run on one's own hardware or optionally on a provider's hardware. This model supports the idea of provisioning specialized analysis and integrating it with the core IC, maintaining the decentralization and security features inherent to the IC.

The group also touched upon the integration of external services like the Render Network into the IC ecosystem, speculating on how specialized hardware or networks could be integrated to provide additional services to IC applications. This led to discussions about the challenges and possibilities of integrating with external decentralized networks, payment for external services, and the need to maintain the security and trust assumptions of the IC while accessing these services.

The call underscored the ongoing efforts to explore off-chain infrastructure improvements and how these could enhance the IC's capabilities, especially in terms of computing power and specialized services. The participants expressed a desire to see these discussions and ideas reflected in future roadmaps, highlighting the importance of benchmarks and quantitative data to drive these developments forward in a measurable and impactful way.
