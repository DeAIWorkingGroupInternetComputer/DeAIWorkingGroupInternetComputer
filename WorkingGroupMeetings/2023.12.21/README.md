# 2023.12.21 Meeting Summary - DeAI Working Group for the Internet Computer (ICP)

The meeting encompassed a comprehensive discussion on the integration and deployment of AI models in decentralized environments, particularly focusing on the Internet Computer (IC) platform. Here's a consolidated summary of the entire meeting:

- Marcin led the initial discussion, highlighting challenges in deploying AI models, especially with C++ and Rust-based systems.
- Two AI frameworks, "Burn" and "Candle," were introduced. "Candle" is popular but lacks extensibility, while "Burn" offers more flexibility with open backends.
- The group discussed experimenting with these frameworks to enhance AI model integration with Rust and C++, with a focus on stable structures.
- Technical aspects, such as computational efficiency and the size of AI models, were debated, alongside considerations of computation costs for network and canister owners.
- The discussion shifted to the "Custom Canisters" feature, enabling custom canister types in dfx.json for user-friendly automated conversions.
- Marcin proposed a custom canister type for AI to streamline model deployment from platforms like Hugging Face.
- The group emphasized improving the developer experience in deploying AI models, regardless of whether they're on decentralized infrastructure.
- A potential AI-focused DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) for infrastructure management was discussed.
- Challenges in using external orchestration platforms like Ray for distributed GPU compute within the IC were highlighted, considering network boundaries and data transfer limits.
- A participant introduced the Ionet Project, seeking clarity on its workflow, particularly regarding booking and deploying on a PPU (Processing Power Unit).
- Icarus, a systems engineering expert shared insights into the technical documentation of software and hardware, stressing the importance of security in decentralized systems.
- The idea of building a GPU subnet within the IC system was discussed, envisioning a secure and efficient model distinct from current Web 3 and Web 2 platforms.
- A request was made for a private session to delve deeper into the technicalities of building infrastructure like Ionet.
- Participants were reminded to contribute to testimonials and brainstorming sessions, focusing on the GPU discussion.
