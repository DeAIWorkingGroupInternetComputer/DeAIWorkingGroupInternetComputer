## Long Version

Introduction and Goals: The call starts with Sam introducing himself and expressing his enthusiasm for developing AI applications related to intellectual property education and processes on the Internet Computer platform (https://forum.dfinity.org/t/crafting-tomorrows-ip-standards-today-with-bipquantum-on-icp/29312/3). He highlights the challenges of integrating blockchain and AI with traditional intellectual property processes.

AI's Role in the Project: Sam details two primary functions of AI in their project:
Consultation: AI is trained to offer advice on copyright and patent issues, providing an affordable alternative to traditional legal consultations.
Proof of Ownership: AI assists in establishing proof of ownership for intellectual properties through a process analogous to minting NFTs but with more complex technical requirements and richer metadata to clarify licensing terms.

Data Accessibility and Legal Challenges: The conversation shifts to the availability of patent databases and the legality of AI-generated content. It is noted that while data from patent offices is accessible, the legal framework has yet to catch up with the realities of AI-generated creations, which are not currently recognized for copyright or patent processes.

The conversation then shifted towards benchmarking efforts, specifically whether any current efforts or planned contributions to benchmarking were underway within the group. They discussed the importance of sharing and coordinating benchmarking efforts to enhance the collective understanding of performance and capabilities.

Interest in Collaborating and Benchmarking: Participants express interest in collaborating and sharing benchmarks related to AI performance on the Internet Computer, suggesting that such data could be valuable for both internal development and external communication about the platform's capabilities.

A significant portion of the call was dedicated to discussing the potential for quantizing models to improve efficiency and performance (https://au.mathworks.com/company/technical-articles/what-is-int8-quantization-and-why-is-it-popular-for-deep-neural-networks.html). This included a detailed exploration of SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions and their potential impact on executing models more efficiently on the Internet Computer's infrastructure. The discussion highlighted the current capabilities of Wasm (WebAssembly, also see https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-nn) and the hardware CPUs (AMD EPIC) used by the Internet Computer, noting the possibilities for utilizing SIMD instructions to process data more efficiently and the impact of quantization on model performance.

Further, the group considered the implications of accessing external compute resources, such as GPUs, from the Internet Computer's environment, noting the challenges and potential approaches for integrating such capabilities. The discussion also touched on the potential for expanding the use of SIMD instructions beyond the current limitations, which could lead to significant performance improvements for running large models and conducting inference on the platform.

Integrated CPU and GPU Architectures: The group discussed the trend towards integrated CPU and GPU architectures, where both processors share the same main memory. This design approach, exemplified by technologies like AMD's MI 300A, facilitates extremely fast data transfer between CPU and GPU, eliminating the need to move data across a PCI bus. This architecture is seen as beneficial for massively parallel compute tasks, such as those required for AI model training and inference.

Quantization and Efficiency: The discussion touched on the potential for quantizing models to further improve efficiency and performance on these integrated architectures. Quantization reduces the precision of model parameters, which can significantly reduce memory requirements and increase computation speed without substantially sacrificing model accuracy. The group expressed interest in exploring how quantization techniques, especially emerging research into one-bit LLMs (Large Language Models), could be aligned with the hardware trends.

Future Hardware Trends: The conversation speculated on future directions in hardware development that could impact AI computation on the Internet Computer. One notable trend is the development of hardware that further blurs the lines between CPU and GPU, offering unified memory architectures and specialized processing units for AI tasks. This could lead to more efficient AI model execution by leveraging the strengths of both processing units in a coherent manner.

Implications for the Internet Computer: The group considered how these hardware trends might influence the development and execution of AI models on the Internet Computer. The potential for integrating such advanced hardware into the Internet Computer's infrastructure could open new avenues for running complex AI models more efficiently.

Call for Topics and Participation: The meeting concluded with an open invitation for participants to suggest topics for future discussions and to share projects or questions they might have. This gesture aimed to foster a collaborative environment where group members can contribute to the agenda and share their insights and challenges.
