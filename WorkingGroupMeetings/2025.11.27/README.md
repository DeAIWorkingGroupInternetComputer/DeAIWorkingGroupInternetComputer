# 2025.11.27 Meeting Summary - DeAI Working Group for the Internet Computer (ICP)

## Short Version
The group opened by reflecting on the macro-tech landscape laid out by Benedict Evans’ recent “AI eats the world” presentation, noting how rapid advances and proliferation of AI reshape not only software but also infrastructure and energy demands. They then discussed ideas from the latest Outlier Ventures’ “Post-Web” report (Chapter 3 update), interpreting its forecast for decentralized, composable Web3 systems and how AI-driven infrastructure and distributed networks could become intertwined. The conversation tied this to parallels in energy and infrastructure planning (including the example of Hydro-Québec and national-level energy strategies like Canada's SMR Action Plan for small modular reactors) for long-term, systemic planning to meet rising electricity demand. Finally, from a purely technical front, they reviewed the WebNN API — a new web-standard specification enabling efficient on-device neural-network computation — as a component enabling decentralized AI on user devices, without reliance on centralized cloud infrastructure. Taken together, the call underscored that for AI and Web3 to succeed sustainably, it's not just about software innovation — we must also think about infrastructure, governance, and long-term systemic resilience.

Very interesting and relevant comment by @icarus (to consider for which game DeAI providers are in and how to play it well):
"So I think the game for small players like ICP is some optimal combination of :
a) much lower capital outlay 
b) lower hosting & power costs
c) much lower operating overhead 
d) find higher value niche inference markets
e) make the inference service tightly integrated into a high value platform of complementary software services"
