# 2023.12.07 Meeting Summary - DeAI Working Group for the Internet Computer (ICP)

In light of our recent discussions, I propose organizing our efforts around several key action items to further advance DeAI projects and innovations on the IC. These include:

## Key Action Items

1. **Showcasing and Communicating DeAI Projects**: Amplifying the visibility of DeAI projects and innovations within the IC community and to the broader audience.
2. **Unique Value Propositions**: Identifying and articulating the unique value propositions for consumers and users of DeAI technologies on the IC.
3. **Educational Materials and Documentation**: Developing comprehensive educational materials and documentation to facilitate understanding and adoption of DeAI technologies.
4. **Wish List for Development**: Compiling a wish list of features and components that would significantly benefit the development of DeAI projects, including the exploration of a GPU subnet as a community-driven effort.
5. **Technical Initiatives**: Pursuing technical initiatives like implementing on-chain vector databases to overcome current limitations and enhance the capabilities of DeAI on the IC.

### Considerations and Challenges

- **Migrating Libraries**: Addressing challenges related to the size limitations (ideally below 2MB) through methods like zipping, while considering the constraints around multi-threading.
- **FAISS Integration**: Evaluating the feasibility of integrating FAISS, given potential challenges with dependencies.
- **Vector Database Limitations**: Assessing the impact of size limits on vector database implementations, referencing projects like Quadrant developed in Rust.
- **Wish List Items**:
  - The need for a dynamic library system to share libraries across projects, reducing the redundancy of hosting libraries individually.
  - Advocating for native system AI/LLM support to streamline development.
  - Emphasizing consumer-facing benefits in DeAI project development.

### Highlight: MotokoLearn V0.1

- Introduction of [MotokoLearn V0.1](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/introduction-of-motokolearn-v0-1-on-chain-training-and-inference-of-machine-learning-models/25312), a pioneering effort to enable on-chain training and inference of machine learning models, marking a significant milestone in the DeAI landscape on the IC.

## Feedback and Additional Items

What are your thoughts on these proposed action items? Are there any other areas or challenges that we should consider addressing in our efforts to advance DeAI on the IC?
