# 2024.09.26 Meeting Summary - DeAI Working Group for the Internet Computer (ICP)

## Short Version
Today's DeAI Working Group call for the Internet Computer focused on potential Delta V integrations, new participant introductions, and plans to publish a DeAI manifesto on ICP with an emphasis on accessibility, self-sovereignty, and AI safety. The group also explored on-chain vector databases, LLM scaling challenges, and standards for LLM inference. Future discussions will address cost efficiency, instruction limits, and the environmental impact of decentralized AI.

## Long Version
Today's DeAI Working Group call for the Internet Computer primarily focused on these key topics:

### Delta V Integration
Delta V, a chat interface connected to an AI engine, uses large language models (LLMs) to search for agents matching specific tasks. Discussion included potential integrations with platforms like Fetch AI and ICP.

### New Participants
Jeremy and Saino introduced themselves. Jeremy expressed excitement about the AI's performance, while Saino opted to listen.

### DeAI Manifesto
The group discussed publishing a DeAI (Decentralized AI) manifesto on the ICP website, highlighting the principles of decentralized AI. Participants provided feedback, suggesting revisions to emphasize accessibility, self-sovereignty, and verifiability. There was also discussion about incorporating AI safety into the manifesto, involving partners like Foresight Institute.

### Vector Databases
One participant shared recent work on a vector embedding model running on-chain using small language models, emphasizing memory and instruction limits. The group discussed the potential for standardizing vector databases and embedding models, referencing existing frameworks like OpenAI and Kinicâ€™s E5 embedding model.

### LLM Scaling and Cost Considerations
Discussion about scaling LLMs on ICP led to concerns over instruction limits and economic viability. Participants also proposed exploring standards for LLM inference and vector databases, incorporating regulatory and compliance perspectives.

### Future Topics
Suggestions for future discussions included cost efficiency, instruction limits, and the environmental impact of decentralized AI.
