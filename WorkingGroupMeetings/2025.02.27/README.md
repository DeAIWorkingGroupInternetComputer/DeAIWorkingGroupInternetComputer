# 2025.02.27 Meeting Summary - DeAI Working Group for the Internet Computer (ICP)

## Short Version
We had two demos during today’s DeAI call: HyperLaunch and Proof-of-AI-Work. HyperLaunch enables the tokenization of AI agents, providing a revenue model through governance and decentralized ownership. In live demo, the ELNA team showcased the tokenization of the Dom3PO AI agent, with future plans for an autonomous podcast agent. onicai introduced Proof-of-AI-Work (PoAIW), a decentralized method inspired by blockchain to verify AI contributions, where AI miners compete and a judge model ranks responses. A fully on-chain AI execution on ICP was demonstrated. The discussion covered governance challenges, ensuring fairness in AI competitions, and balancing model performance with decentralized decision-making.

## Long Version
# Presentation & Demo of HyperLaunch

## ELNA (AI Token Launchpad)
HyperLaunch aims to tokenize AI agents to provide a revenue model for AI-based applications.  
AI agents in various fields (education, tech, agriculture, etc.) will each have their own tokenomics and governance system.  

A demo was given, showing how a Twitter-based AI agent can be tokenized and deployed.  
- Dom3PO AI agent was tokenized and made live during the demo.  
- Plans for a podcast agent that can autonomously generate and deploy podcast episodes.  

# Presentation of Proof of AI Work (PoAIW)

## Onicai's Approach to AI Decentralization
- Focus on merging AI and decentralized tech to control and coordinate AI agents.  
- Agents should prove they are doing useful work (inspired by Bitcoin’s Proof of Work).  
- Concept introduced in a superlite paper with a full litepaper coming soon.  
- AI miners compete to solve tasks, and a judge AI model ranks responses to determine rewards.  
- Fully on-chain AI model execution on ICP was demonstrated.  

## Open Discussion on Governance & Tokenomics for AI Agents
- Attendees discussed potential governance mechanisms where token holders could influence agent decisions.  
- Challenges include preventing dominance by the most powerful AI models in competitions.  
- Multi-round AI competitions (where models can refine responses) were suggested.  

## Key Takeaways
- **HyperLaunch** enables AI tokenization to monetize AI models through governance and decentralized ownership.  
- **Proof of AI Work (PoAIW)** introduces a decentralized method for verifying AI agent contributions, inspired by blockchain consensus models.  
- Governance and AI coordination challenges were discussed, with a focus on balancing model performance and fairness.
