# DeAI Working Group for the Internet Computer (ICP)
The Internet Computer enables truly decentralizing AI by running services on-chain. We are proud of community achievements like having deployed the first ever on-chain LLM and vector database, training Machine Learning algorithms in a canister, implementing practical Zero-Knowledge AI and porting popular ML/AI frameworks and libraries.

We're thrilled to have you join the DeAI on IC community and can't wait to see what you'll accomplish. Please find us here and come say hello:
